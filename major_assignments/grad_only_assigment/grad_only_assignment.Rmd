#How can you describe (broadly) the partyâ€™s donors? Where do the parties get their money and from what kinds of donors? Do they raise a lot in small amounts or from out of state donors?

Reps:
The Republican Committee received the most contributions in state at a total of $3,072,852.95. In total the party received $7,900,602 in contributions. Other states that contributed high amounts include DC, Maryland and Virginia. The top cities that gave the most contributions were Arlington, Raleigh and Charlotte. However, when looking at total dollar amounts Washington was the highest at $3,061,649, followed by Raleigh at $968,834.38 and Bethesda at $381,911.40.6,247 were from individuals and 2,968 were from	other committees. The most donations were between $101 and $500 at 2,171. The second most donations were between $10 and $25 at 2,107. The least amount of contributions were between $501 and $1,000 at 226. The majority of donors were retired. A few interesting top employers at the individual level were TWJ Farms (A farm in Nebraska) and Wells Fargo. 

Dems:
The Democratic Committee received the most contributions from DC at $5,732,950.29. Other states that contributed high amounts include North Carolina and New York. The cities with the most contributions were Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. However, Washington also had the highest total dollar amount of donations at $5,732,854.04. Overall, the majority of donations were less than $10 at 3,379. The top employers were self-employed and retired. Some stand-out employers were Duke University, Imangi Studios and 27 City Square Consulting Inc. 
 

#What did the party spend its money on? You may need OpenRefine to help you standardize the purpose of spending. Can you tell much about the strategy behind the spending from the data?

Rep:
Overall, the Republican Committee spent $6,495,216 over the year. Over the course of the year, the committee spent the most on payroll at $1,831,220.03. The next highest was EXEMPT VOLUNTEER MAILING at 777,036.31. The third highest was PAYROLL TAXES at 630,372.81. Another interesting expenditure was the balance owed for the 2021 NCGOP state convention at 40,000.00. Organizations that received significant funds from the committee are Political INK, which does direct mail for Republican campaigns, and ADP Easypay (a direct deposit company). 

When looking at how expenses changed over time, after the primary election the party spent the most on exempt volunteer mailing at $777,0361.31. However, before the primary the committee spent the most on payroll at $1,152,108.15. Overall spending also decreased on payroll after the primary.

A possible strategy for this spending could be targeting voters via mail closer to the midterm election, which is why the funds increased after the primary. 


Dem:
In total the Democratic Committee spent $6,580,343 with an average contribution amount of $3,854.917.The committee spent the most on payroll and mailers for Don Davis, a democratic state senator. The top recipients of their spending were The Paystub People (payroll company), Deliver Strategies LLC (a political strategy firm) and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Before the primary, the committee spent the most on payroll at $1,152,108.15 but after the primary, the top spending was for mailers at $972,444.50. The committee also increased spending on payroll after the primary.


#When you compare the two parties, where are the differences and similarities?

One of the major differences between the two parties is that Republicans received more contributions from in-state donors. Both groups spent the majority of their funds on payroll with Democrats increasing spending on payroll after the primary and  Overall, Democrats raised more money but in smaller amounts of contributions. Meanwhile, Republicans had a greater amount of larger donations. Both committees received funds from similar cities within North Carolina. The majority of the North Carolina cities that gave money to both committees were from wealthier or more populated parts of the state such a Chapel Hill, Raleigh and Charlotte.

#What about either the donors or the spending prompts further questions from you?
I would be interested to see how contributions from North Carolina cities have changed over time. Did the contributions from both parties always come cities that were similar? Or has it changed over time? 

I also think it would be worth looking further into some of the employers of the contributors. For example, why is the same farm in Nebraska responsible for 27 contributions? 

Another question: Is North Carolina unique compared to other states in receiving a lot of donations from out-of-state donors?
