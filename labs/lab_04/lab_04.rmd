## Getting Started

This week we'll be combining and joining data to make it more useful and to ask some questions about it. We'll use Maryland 2022 primary precinct election results to do this, and our main question will be this: Which precincts had the most votes cast at them statewide, counting both the Republican and Democratic primaries? To answer this question, we'll need to first combine the two parties' primary precinct results into a single dataframe and then join it to data that has more information about each voting location.

First, load the two precinct results CSV files in the `data` folder, one each for the Democratic and Republican primaries, and then combine them into a single dataframe using the method we used in the pre_lab. You'll need to clean up the column names to make the data easier to work with - make sure you have loaded the library to do that.

```{r}
#Load two precinct results 
md_primary_precinct_dem <- read_csv("data/md_primary_precinct_dem.csv")
md_primary_precinct_rep <- read_csv("data/md_primary_precinct_rep.csv")

#Combine in a single dataframe
precinct_data_combined <- bind_rows(list(md_primary_precinct_dem, md_primary_precinct_rep))
View(precinct_data_combined)

#Clean combined dataframe
# cleaning function
cleaned_precinct_data_combined <- precinct_data_combined %>%
  clean_names()

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_precinct_data_combined <- cleaned_precinct_data_combined %>% mutate(county = as.character(county))

cleaned_precinct_data_combined <- cleaned_precinct_data_combined %>% mutate(election_district_precinct = as.character(election_district_precinct))
                                               
cleaned_precinct_data_combined
```

Next, let's read in the precinct voting location data and make sure you clean up the column names:

```{r}
#Load precinct voting locations
precinct_voting_locations <- read_csv("data/precinct_voting_locations.csv")

#Clean precinct voting locations
# cleaning function
cleaned_precinct_voting_locations <- precinct_voting_locations %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
mutate(precinct_code = as.character(precinct_code))
cleaned_precinct_voting_locations <- cleaned_precinct_voting_locations %>% mutate(county_code = as.character(county_code)) 

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_precinct_voting_locations
```

These two dataframes have a pair of columns in common - not necessarily with the same column names. Join the two dataframes on that unique combination that describes a precinct and the jurisdiction that contains it:

```{r}
primary_precinct_with_voting_locations <- cleaned_precinct_data_combined %>% left_join(cleaned_precinct_voting_locations, by=c("election_district_precinct"="precinct_code","county"= "county_code"))

primary_precinct_with_voting_locations
```

## Answer questions

Q1. Using the newly-created dataframe and isolating just the results for Wes Moore and Aruna Miller, write code that calculates how many voting locations each county has, showing the county with the most voting locations first. There's a catch: multiple precincts can share the same voting location, so you'll need to calculate the distinct number of locations (Google is your friend).

Does the county with the most voting locations have the largest population in the state (ask yourself: where have you seen county population figures recently)?

A1. Prince George's County is the second most populated county in Maryland. Montgomery County is the most populated. 

```{r}
#isolating results for just Wes Moore and Aruna Miller

primary_precinct_with_voting_locations %>% filter(candidate_name == "Wes Moore and Aruna Miller") %>% 
group_by(county_name) %>% 
summarize(count = n_distinct(location_name)) %>% 
arrange(desc(count))                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                            


```


Q2. Write code to produce a `votes` column which is the result of adding together `early_votes`, `election_night_votes`, `provisional_votes` and the mail-in votes, overwriting your dataframe so that it now has that `total_votes` column going forward. Then, separately write code to show each county and precinct and calculate the total votes in the Governor's race - bearing in mind that each precinct will have multiple rows in the dataframe, but you only want to see one row for each precinct. What is the name and voting location of the precinct that saw the most votes in the governor's race? 

A2. Election district precinct 15,005 located at DR. HENRY A. WISE, JR. HIGH SCHOOL saw the most votes at 2,396. This is Prince George's County. 

```{r}
#code for total_votes in each county and each precinct
combined_total_votes <- primary_precinct_with_voting_locations %>%  group_by(election_district_precinct, location_name, county_name) %>% 
summarize(total_votes = sum(election_night_votes, early_votes, provisional_votes, mail_in_ballot_1_votes, mail_in_ballot_2_votes, count = n_distinct(location_name))) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_votes))



#Governor's Race

gov_voting_locations <- primary_precinct_with_voting_locations %>% 
filter(office_name == "Governor / Lt. Governor") %>% 
group_by(county_name,location_name,election_district_precinct) %>% 
summarize(total_votes = sum(election_night_votes, early_votes, provisional_votes, mail_in_ballot_1_votes, mail_in_ballot_2_votes)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_votes))

gov_voting_locations %>% distinct(county_name, location_name, election_district_precinct)  


```

Q3. Let's look at the average number of votes in each party's primary race for governor. Take the code you wrote for the last part of Q2, save the results to a new variable and then find the precincts with 0 total votes for governor. How many precincts are there, and which county has the most? What else would you need to know about these precincts to know whether this might be worth a story?

12 precincts with zero votes. Four precincts in Prince George's County have zero precincts. To write a story I would need to know how many people live in this precinct to understand if a large amount of people were not voting. 
```{r}
#Precincts with 0 total votes
gov_voting_locations

```

Finally, write code to calculate the average and median number of total votes across all precincts statewide (so you want to see just two numbers - the average and median). To do this, you will need to use the `ungroup()` function on your new dataframe _before_ you do the math - https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/multiplyr/versions/0.1.1/topics/ungroup. There's no state column here, so you aren't grouping by anything, but can still use summarize to do the math.

Take a look at the the Annotated Code of Maryland's election laws (https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/Statute_Web/gel/gel.pdf) - can you find a limit on the number of voters assigned to a precinct? How might your answer impact wait times to vote?

A3. mean: 465.8766	median:418. There is no limit on the voters assigned. This could cause wait time to be very long at certain precincts. 

```{r}
gov_voting_locations %>% 
ungroup () %>% 
summarise(
  mean_total_vote = mean(total_votes),
  median_total_vote = median(total_votes))
```

Q4. Choose your own adventure: I want you to come up with a question you could ask of one of the dataframes we've created for this lab. It could involve candidates, or counties or types of voting, but it cannot be a variation of a previous question (so, for example, you can't ask, "What's the average number of votes per precinct in the U.S. Senate primary?"). First write the question and then try to answer it by writing code. If you're not sure of the exact code, try googling (or ask me or Ramsay for advice) but, at a minimum, describe what you think you'd have to do to answer it and what the results would look like. That can help.
A4: Which candidate had the most election night votes? How does this candidate compare to the one with the second most votes?
Answer: Chris Van Hollen at	198,111 had the most. Brooke Elizabeth Lierman was the second at 163,249	 votes. 

```{r}
primary_precinct_with_voting_locations %>% 
group_by(candidate_name) %>% 
summarize(total_votes = sum(election_night_votes)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_votes))  
```
